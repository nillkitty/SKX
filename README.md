# SKX
An open-source .NET remake of the NES version of Solomon's Key with new features, new levels, and an integrated level editor that runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Features
* Faithful port of the **classic** NES Solomon's Key gameplay, levels, layouts, behavior (53 levels)
* Extended **plus mode** with new secrets, rooms, items, enemies, game mechanics, and characters (170+ levels)
* Integrated level editor and debug mode
* Windows, Mac, Linux
* Extensible architecture

For more information see the [full documentation in the wiki](https://github.com/nillkitty/SKX/wiki) .

## Accuracy
* Fairy AI is smoother and not NES accurate
* Some gameplay elements (e.g. Room 7) behave slightly differently due to the lack of lag imposed by the NES.  I have tried to compensate enemy speeds where necessary.
